# Absenteeism-Project
The goal is to predict the severity of the duration of absenteeism of an employee in a company based on several features
We will model the data and identify the significant and non-significant feature
We will study the changes in the model's performance with and without the presence of non-significant features
We will look at the statistical impact of each feature to the liklihood of an employee being excessively absent
